# Flowers-Recognition
A small machine learning project in python that helps to classify a flower based on 4 features into one of the three categories(Supervised learning classification)
In this project we process our data and then feed them on three famous unsupervised algorithms mainly Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector
machine , Decision tree and everytime after doing some preprocessing on the data we record our observation of the data on each algorithm
